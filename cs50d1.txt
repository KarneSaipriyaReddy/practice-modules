started the course of cs50 from harvard university today
learnt what is computer science , computational thinking
unary -used by humans to calcuate i.e., base 10
binary - base 2
decimal [ computer uses binary , we use decimal to read the o/p given by computer]
A bit is either 0 or 1
1 byte =  8 bits
In computers terminology A( other alphabest along with some symbols) are given certain value & those values are called ASCII values
repreesentation of numbers in binary are as follows:
1 - 001
2 - 010
3 - 110
4 - 100
5 - 101
all the above nos are calculated as : 1 - 2^0 * 1 + 2^0 * 1 + 2^0 * 3 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
In general we can convert binary numbers to decimal numbers as 
2^0 * units place + 2^1 * tens place + 2^2 * hundereds place ......
Unicode mapping numbers to letters in various languages
All the features that we are using in our day to day life like emojis, gifs etc do have a unique binary code which is understood by the computer
And the emojis color code hasbeen generated by rgb color code background and all the pixels that are present in an emoji will have certain ratio of rgb colors
